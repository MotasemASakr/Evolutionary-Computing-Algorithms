# Evolutionary Computing Algorithms
Evolutionary Computation (EC) is a sub-field of computational intelligence that deals with several computational techniques which are based to some degree on the evolution of biological life in the natural world. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is the most widely used form of EC. It is an adaptive heuristic search algorithm that is designed to simulate processes in natural system necessary for evolution proposed by Charles Darwin. This algorithm represents an intelligent exploitation of a random search within a defined search space to solve a problem.
